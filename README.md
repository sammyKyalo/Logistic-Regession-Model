# Logistic-Regession-Model
I develoved a Logistic Regresion Algorithm  to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
My primary focus is on understanding the risk factors and predicting heart disease using logistic regression. The goal of this study is to enhance early prognosis and suggest lifestyle changes for high-risk patients to decrease complications associated with cardiovascular disease. With an astonishing estimate of 12 million deaths happening globally each year, it is crucial to identify the most notable risk factors associated with heart disease. By analyzing data patterns and recognizing the key features contributing to heart disease, my research will delve deeply into risk assessment techniques. Furthermore, logistic regression will be utilized to predict the overall risk of heart disease in high-risk patients. This study's findings will contribute to the current pool of knowledge on heart disease by highlighting the most significant risk factors and providing a dependable risk assessment tool. Ultimately, my research will aid in improving the treatment and management of patients with heart disease.
